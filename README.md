* Setting up our computers for web development
* Setting up your HTML with CSS
* Basic CSS syntax and features
* Advanced CSS features
* Playing around in the sandbox

#### Before you begin, a quick gut check:

Feel free to move ahead
Help others when you can
Be patient and nice
You will get through it!

#### What web coding is (really)?

Recipes to give to your computer to “cook” up some awesome things for you online

## Setting up your computer

(Brace yourself...)

#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: chrome.google.com)
* A text editor to modify your files (Recommend the Atom text editor: Atom.io)
* Download the tutorial files on this page within the zip file

####  Download the file for this class:

1. Go to https://github.com/GalvanizeOpenSource/Learn-To-Code-Intro-CSS
2. Click on the button on the right-hand side that says "Download ZIP"
3. Go to your downloads folder and double click on the .zip file to unzip it
4. From Atom: File > open, select the folder and then click "Open"
5. From Atom: If the file tree does not appear on the left hand View > Toggle Tree View -- this will show you the entire folder within Atom
6. Open up the file in your browser -- 
  a. index.html
  b. style.css

#### Alternative: Use CodePen to code for this course

1. Go to this link https://codepen.io/leepngo/pen/KgrLNw[https://codepen.io/leepngo/pen/KgrLNw](https://codepen.io/leepngo/pen/KgrLNw). You will be taken to a page where you can simulate the coding experience.
Focus on the window called "HTML" and "CSS". We'll work mostly in that one. Feel free to close the "JS" window.

Patience! Setting up your computer takes time and can be tricky, especially across platforms.

Once you're ready, you can move onto the next lesson.
